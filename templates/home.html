            Having bought in the online store always want to know where the package is now? To save time checking the sites of postal companies manually, I created "Parcels" website and mobile apps which will automatically check every relevant postal, courier, and logistics company website on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p class="px-4 text-center text-sm max-w-2xl">
            To find out where your parcel is, you need to know only tracking number of your package.

        <h2 class="text-2xl">What is a tracking number?</h2>

    <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center mt-4 space-y-4">
        <p class="px-4 text-center text-sm max-w-2xl">
            Tracking number or tracking code is a unique number assigned to each package, which allows you to monitor the movement of the parcel between the countries or even inside one country.
        </p>
        <p class="px-4 text-center text-sm max-w-2xl">
            Tracking numbers can be international or traceable only within the country of the sender.
        </p>
        <p class="px-4 text-center text-sm max-w-2xl">
            The tracking number in the format of the Universal Postal Union looks like RA123456789CN, where the first 2 letters are the type of package and the last 2 letters are the code of the country of origin. Packages with such numbers can be tracked right until delivery.
        </p>
        <p class="px-4 text-center text-sm max-w-2xl">
            Other shipments can be delivered by courier, transport and logistics companies, and how tracking codes look can vary a lot: CTAFT0000160477YQ, UPAAB000000251682107, AEL10105033654UA, SGADN143797855. Such packages are not always trackable in the recipient's country, and you'll have to wait for notification from the Post Office or a call from a courier company.

        <h2 class="text-2xl">How to track a parcel from an online store?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center mt-4 space-y-4">
        <p class="px-4 text-center text-sm max-w-2xl">
            First of all, you should wait for the order to be shipped. When preparing to send your purchases, the seller reserves a track number from the delivery service, which starts to be tracked within 1-5 days after the order is transferred to the delivery service.
        </p>
        <p class="px-4 text-center text-sm max-w-2xl">
            Remember that you can track the parcel only by tracking number, most often try to track using the order number, but these are two completely different numbers, and you can not track the parcel by order number. The exception is the ASOS store, and on our service you can track ASOS orders by order number.

        <h2 class="text-2xl">Can't track package for a long time?</h2>

    <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center mt-4 space-y-4">
        <p class="px-4 text-center text-sm max-w-2xl">
            Do not panic if the package is not trackable right after you've got the tracking number. Postal or courier company takes time to arrange the parcel, weigh, prepare customs documents, sort & forward package further along the route. You can start to sound the alarm already from the 7th day after receiving the tracking number, most likely the seller has not shipped parcel, and only reserved the tracking number.
